Check_path

How it works:
os.environ: This is a dictionary-like object that contains all your environment variables.

os.pathsep: This is a built-in Python constant that automatically knows whether to use a semicolon or a colon based on whether you are running the script in Windows or Linux.

enumerate(path_list, 1): This allows us to loop through the list while keeping a counter that starts at 1, making the output easy to read.

Running it on Linux Mint:
If you saved this as check_path.py, you would run it in your terminal with: python3 check_path.py

Would you like me to modify the script so it also checks if each directory in your PATH actually exists on your hard drive?
